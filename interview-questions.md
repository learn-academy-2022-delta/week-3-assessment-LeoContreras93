# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: `This` is used to reference key/value pairs in a class which are dynamic compared to objects which are not dynamic. 

  Researched answer: like event handlers, we basically give a reference to a function of the react events when the event is invoked. `This ` keyword would be used to reference data stored in state or a method.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a JavaSript libray made up of a collection of code snippets used for building user interfaces. Code is reusable and handles user interactions. it is also scalable which allows you to think about how your app will grow.

  Researched answer: React allows for developers to create large web applications. Allows for data to be manipulated without reloading a web page when a user is interacting with the interface. The virtual DOM is listening for a diff. Reusable components such as classes.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: Anytime you are creating a class component, import which allows using contents from another file, define the class and extend component. render method, return and export which makes files contents elgible for importing.

  Researched answer: the lifecycle of components which can be manipulated during the three main phases are mounting, updating and unmounting.contructor method and render method are part of the mounting phase, updating phase include any updates made to the class componenet. when a componenet is removed from the DOM the phase is referred to to as the unmounting phase.



4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: My understanding of JSX is that its a markdown language combined of HTML and JavaScript. When typing JSX language in react it is required to use curly braces in order for JavaScript language to be read properly within the HTML code.

  Researched answer: I would say its like a template language. The difference in syntax is the combination of using JavaScript code and curly braces with HTML tags. JSX can used to specify attributes can also be used inside of `if statements`, `for loops`. JSX can also be assigned to `vairables`,arguments and be part of a `return` in a function.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a JavaScript package manager that creates the file structure of a React app.Yarn also organizes and manages the node modules.

  Researched answer: Yarn manages files in node.js-open source, cross platform used on the front and back end, also uses files like yarn.lock-main source of information about a current project and package.json-holds metadate relevant to the project.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: a function that is not named or does not have value, High order functions use anonymous functions?

  Researched answer: Anonymouse functions can be called upon by other functions like high order functions which takes a function as an argument and anonymous functions do not require a name.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: the ability to create different components that encapsulate {} a behavior you need. Based on the definition I would assume these are placed in the rendor method area in your class component?

2. Object-oriented programming: or OOP is programming language of patterns? allows for sectioning off data and manipulating certain data without affecting the entire program.

3. Ruby: is an object-orientated progam, the mantra of ruby is `everything is an object`. Essentially is an object-data type that is a collection of things.

4. Ruby blocks: contain anoymous functions similar to JavaScript, created with the do/end keywords or with {}. blocks can be passed onto methods and can also have multiple parameters.

5. Ruby hashes: colletion of unique keys and their values, similar to arrays. can be used on interable methods.
